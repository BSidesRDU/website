The reason why no one knows is honeypot technology has a hidden bias- it only captures attacks directed to it. This bias might be self-evident but a critical side effect might not be so obvious. Spitzner introduced honeypots in 1999 and within five years research appeared asserting a method to detect and attack them. There are two reasons underpinning the significance of such a discovery."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"First, defenders deploy enough honeypots that adversaries have a vested interest in understanding how to attack them."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Second, and less obvious, attackers must have a reliable methodology to detect honeypots."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"To that end, we don't know how many attackers don't attack honeypots. Think about it: do you know how an attacker might detect your honeypot or differentiate between deceptive and legitimate systems on your perimeter? After all, attackers have a vested interest in understanding how to detect honeypots in the wild. They don't want to waste time. They don't want to increase risk without raising the potential payout. They want to maintain confidentiality of their tools and techniques."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Oddly enough, existing research is not clear on what network or system attributes reveal a high interaction honeypot. Consequently, no one knows to what extent attackers may be detecting and avoiding honeypots. At best, this limits the ability for researchers to develop more robust honeypots which can evade detection.

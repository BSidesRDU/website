<h2>Keynote<h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
For a word that appears nowhere in the U.S. Constitution, privacy holds outsized—and underappreciated—significance to constitutional rights. Why does privacy matter, and how does its erosion undermine not only constitutional rights but also democracy in America writ large? Beyond exploring and applying constitutional theory to topics from mass surveillance to police militarization, we will also discuss how concerned Americans are already taking action every day to reclaim freedom of expression in an era of arbitrary surveillance.
</p>

<p>
<h3>About Shahid</h3>
<strong>Shahid</strong> leads EFF's grassroots and student outreach efforts. He's a constitutional lawyer focused on the intersection of community organizing and policy reform as a lever to shift legal norms, with roots in communities across the country resisting mass surveillance. From 2009 to 2015, he led the Bill of Rights Defense Committee as Executive Director. In 2018, Shahid ran for Congress, seeking to represent California's 12th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</p><p>
After graduating from Stanford Law School in 2003, where he grew immersed in the movement to stop the war in Iraq, Shahid worked for a decade in Washington, D.C. He first worked in private practice for a California-based law firm, with public interest litigation projects advancing campaign finance reform and marriage equality for same-sex couples (as early as 2004, when LGBT rights remained politically marginal). From 2005 to 2008, he helped build a national progressive legal network and managed the communications team at the American Constitution Society for Law & Policy, before founding the program to combat racial & religious profiling at Muslim Advocates in 2008.
</p><p>
Outside of his work at EFF, Shahid also DJs and produces electronic music, writes poetry & prose, kicks rhymes, organizes guerilla poetry insurgencies, plays capoeira, speaks truth to power on Truthout, occasionally elucidates legal scholarship, and documents counter-cultural activism for the Burning Man Journal. He also serves on the Boards of Directors of Defending Rights and Dissent, the Center for Media Justice, and the Fund for Constitutional Government.

<h2>Approaching Parity: Considerations for adapting enterprise monitoring and incident response (IR) capabilities for efficacy in cloud environments, and how to operationalize these capabilities with a playbook.</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There is no denying the ubiquity of cloud computing, and for most organizations, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in particular as the new norm. The model for cloud security is typically a shared responsibility between the provider and the consumer, which really means the consumer is ultimately responsible. Whether your infrastructure is completely hosted, is partly hosted, or is soon-to-be hosted in the cloud, your security posture must adapt appropriately if your monitoring and Incident response capabilities are to remain effective.
</p><p>
Developing an accurate view of nefarious activity in cloud environments still requires the multi-layered approach it did in the enterprise; however, it must adapt to include sources such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudTrail IaaS logs, VPC Flow logs, endpoint logs, and more. This data must be captured and arranged in a manner to make it actionable, requiring you to have a plan for the IR lifecycle—even though you might not own the mitigation process.
</p><p>
Approaching Parity is a talk about adapting your security posture for monitoring and IR in IaaS environments, through native capabilities, third-party products, via workaround, or any combination of the three, and then operationalizing this telemetry with the CSIRT playbook. Though this talk provides AWS IaaS examples, the topics presented are applicable to other IaaS providers too.
</p>

<h2>Movement After Initial Compromise</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Once a system is compromised there are many avenues to consider. It brings up a lot of questions. Who am I on this network? Where am I in this network? Can I move to another system with my current permissions? Can I privilege escalate on my current system? We are going to go over enumeration utilizing “living off the land” techniques and on tools that an attacker can use for enumeration. Examples of some tools that we will go over for enumeration are SharpHound, Powersploit’s collection of Microsoft Powershell modules and others.
</p><p>
We will then go into what is Port Forwarding and why it is useful. Then we will show several ways to execute Port Forwarding. We will have video examples for utilizing SOCKS in Cobalt Strike and SSH port forwarding techniques. Once enumeration is done we will go over how to move to another system on the network. We will provide multiple examples such as; WMIC, Psexec, AT, Schtasks, WINrm, Remote Registry, DCOM, Multi-relay, SMB-relay. Screenshot and videos will be provided during the talk. The last part we will go over is how to detect or attempt to protect against these techniques that attackers implement.</p>

<h2>Our Docker app got hacked. Now what?</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Someone deployed their application as a Docker container. Then another someone came along and hacked it. Now everyone is looking at you asking, "How did this happen? What did the attacker do? How do we stop this from happening again!?" If this were a normal physical server or VM, it'd be no problem: you'd just crack open traditional forensic tools and start building a forensic history from the disk image. But this is a Docker container... and your tools don't know what Docker containers are. So now what?
<p></p>
In this talk, we'll go over what a Docker container looks like from a forensic viewpoint. We'll dig into how you can get access to the underlying disk/filesystem data of a compromised container and which existing forensic tools that you may already use can still apply. We'll also cover what new forensic opportunities Docker provides and new metadata that can be extracted that wouldn't be available on a conventional system. When we're done, you'll know how to tear apart a Docker container and get all those people turning to you the answers they need.
</p>

<h2>Security Automation for the Blue Team</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Supposedly, there's a shortage of Information Security professionals. Some people agree while others disagree. However, there is one thing most infosec professionals will agree on… and that is the fact that we all run around like our hair is on fire because we don't have enough resources to accomplish everything that needs to get done. I know this is the case for most infosec people I talk to. Even if we get an additional headcount, our list of compliance check-boxes, projects, and daily responsibilities keep growing at a phenomenal pace.
  How do we keep up with this fast-paced growth, insane workload, alerts out our ears and no end in sight? One of the best ways to make a big impact is through automation. Whether you have a massive budget or no budget at all, I will discuss your options and how to start the automation journey… or improve upon what you already have. I'll talk about using existing tools, creating your own scripts, using API's and even the latest fad in security automation, SOAR (security operations analytics and reporting). We will discuss how to determine what you should automate first, automation use cases in infosec, and how to tell if there’s something you shouldn’t automate. Let's face it, we are over tooled and understaffed… We need automation to help us out.

<h2>Rise of the Advisor</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  We have a problem in security today. We simply don’t have enough people to cover all the needs. Colleges and technical schools are starting Cyber specific programs, but those are going to be academic practitioners and are going to need time to season in the industry. Vendors are pushing out more and more tools or information on what is or isn’t going wrong in customers networks from not only detection-based alerts, but from vulnerability, risk and compliance standpoints.

  We are monitoring more and more of a user’s presence on the network but we are creating more and more noise for ourselves while we have been trying to reduce and refine the noise. We need something new, or we need to recognize something that we used to have and bring it back to the front. We lost coordination at the tactical level across the security stack.
</p><p>
  The purpose of this talk is to draw from years of experience in the vendor world in look at customers organization structures and make a case for what works and what doesn’t work. It’s based on architectural principles but not specific to a compliance version or to the plumbing of a security stack.
</p><p>
  Attendees will leave with a better understanding of how they can work with and influence their security teams positively along with internally marketing for the recognition of a new role within the security organization.

<h2>No Network Needed?!?!</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  It seems every day, we are bombarded with news of yet another breach and our personal information being traded and sold on the dark web/Internet.  We lose sleep wondering if we have the right controls and policies in place to prevent our companies and our names from appearing in the next morning’s headlines.  Is it time for a different approach?  What if we could get rid of our network so we no longer had to define complex boundaries and policies?  Is it really possible to architect a system that removes all the traditional ingress and egress points?  If we resign ourselves to the fact that it’s not IF but WHEN our network gets breached….then why do we still have a network?

<h2>WarGames</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Shall we play a game? We all have war stories from our time fighting the good fight. In my WarGames session I will share several of my favorite war stories from my cyber front lines. Each one will speak to a problem common in defensive cyber operations and hopefully be interesting in and of themselves. At the end of each war story I will try to draw and share some cyber security insights just like Joshua, &ldquo;A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?&rdquo;</p>

Security BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and by cyber security community members.
The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration.
It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.
<br><br>
Security is top of mind across the entire sphere of IT and the world beyond. Therefore, more people and organizations are interested in the next new thing in security. BSides is the place where these people come to collaborate, learn and share.
<br><br>
With many tech-companies, colleges and universities in Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and surrounding areas, it is also an international center of innovation in the security industry.
<br><br>
Security B-Sides Raleigh-Durham (B-Sides RDU) is proud to have had great speaker lineups at our events including keynotes by Dan Kaminsky, Dave Kennedy, Paul Vixie, BenTen, Jay Beale, G.Mark Hardy, and for B-Sides RDU 2017: Cliff Stoll.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
For a word that appears nowhere in the U.S. Constitution, privacy holds outsized—and underappreciated—significance to constitutional rights. Why does privacy matter, and how does its erosion undermine not only constitutional rights but also democracy in America writ large? Beyond exploring and applying constitutional theory to topics from mass surveillance to police militarization, we will also discuss how concerned Americans are already taking action every day to reclaim freedom of expression in an era of arbitrary surveillance.
</p>

<p>
<h3>About Shahid</h3>
<strong>Shahid</strong> leads EFF's grassroots and student outreach efforts. He's a constitutional lawyer focused on the intersection of community organizing and policy reform as a lever to shift legal norms, with roots in communities across the country resisting mass surveillance. From 2009 to 2015, he led the Bill of Rights Defense Committee as Executive Director. In 2018, Shahid ran for Congress, seeking to represent California's 12th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</p><p>
After graduating from Stanford Law School in 2003, where he grew immersed in the movement to stop the war in Iraq, Shahid worked for a decade in Washington, D.C. He first worked in private practice for a California-based law firm, with public interest litigation projects advancing campaign finance reform and marriage equality for same-sex couples (as early as 2004, when LGBT rights remained politically marginal). From 2005 to 2008, he helped build a national progressive legal network and managed the communications team at the American Constitution Society for Law & Policy, before founding the program to combat racial & religious profiling at Muslim Advocates in 2008.
</p><p>
Outside of his work at EFF, Shahid also DJs and produces electronic music, writes poetry & prose, kicks rhymes, organizes guerilla poetry insurgencies, plays capoeira, speaks truth to power on Truthout, occasionally elucidates legal scholarship, and documents counter-cultural activism for the Burning Man Journal.

<h2>Approaching Parity: Considerations for adapting enterprise monitoring and incident response (IR) capabilities for efficacy in cloud environments, and how to operationalize these capabilities with a playbook.</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There is no denying the ubiquity of cloud computing, and for most organizations, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in particular as the new norm. The model for cloud security is typically a shared responsibility between the provider and the consumer, which really means the consumer is ultimately responsible. Whether your infrastructure is completely hosted, is partly hosted, or is soon-to-be hosted in the cloud, your security posture must adapt appropriately if your monitoring and Incident response capabilities are to remain effective.
</p><p>
Developing an accurate view of nefarious activity in cloud environments still requires the multi-layered approach it did in the enterprise; however, it must adapt to include sources such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudTrail IaaS logs, VPC Flow logs, endpoint logs, and more. This data must be captured and arranged in a manner to make it actionable, requiring you to have a plan for the IR lifecycle—even though you might not own the mitigation process.
</p><p>
Approaching Parity is a talk about adapting your security posture for monitoring and IR in IaaS environments, through native capabilities, third-party products, via workaround, or any combination of the three, and then operationalizing this telemetry with the CSIRT playbook. Though this talk provides AWS IaaS examples, the topics presented are applicable to other IaaS providers too.

<h2>Movement After Initial Compromise</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Once a system is compromised there are many avenues to consider. It brings up a lot of questions. Who am I on this network? Where am I in this network? Can I move to another system with my current permissions? Can I privilege escalate on my current system? We are going to go over enumeration utilizing “living off the land” techniques and on tools that an attacker can use for enumeration. Examples of some tools that we will go over for enumeration are SharpHound, Powersploit’s collection of Microsoft Powershell modules and others.
</p><p>
We will then go into what is Port Forwarding and why it is useful. Then we will show several ways to execute Port Forwarding. We will have video examples for utilizing SOCKS in Cobalt Strike and SSH port forwarding techniques. Once enumeration is done we will go over how to move to another system on the network. We will provide multiple examples such as; WMIC, Psexec, AT, Schtasks, WINrm, Remote Registry, DCOM, Multi-relay, SMB-relay. Screenshot and videos will be provided during the talk. The last part we will go over is how to detect or attempt to protect against these techniques that attackers implement.</p>

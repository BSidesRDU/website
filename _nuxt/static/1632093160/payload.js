The objective of deceiving attackers is either to develop new countermeasures or distract them from targeting production systems. But do honeypots work, are they effective in these roles?\nThe honest answer is no one knows. The reason why no one knows is honeypot technology has a hidden bias- it only captures attacks directed to it. This bias might be self-evident but a critical side effect might not be so obvious. Spitzner introduced honeypots in 1999 and within five years research appeared asserting a method to detect and attack them. There are two reasons underpinning the significance of such a discovery.\nFirst, defenders deploy enough honeypots that adversaries have a vested interest in understanding how to attack them.\nSecond, and less obvious, attackers must have a reliable methodology to detect honeypots.\nTo that end, we don't know how many attackers don't attack honeypots. Think about it: do you know how an attacker might detect your honeypot or differentiate between deceptive and legitimate systems on your perimeter? After all, attackers have a vested interest in understanding how to detect honeypots in the wild. They don't want to waste time. They don't want to increase risk without raising the potential payout. They want to maintain confidentiality of their tools and techniques.\nOddly enough, existing research is not clear on what network or system attributes reveal a high interaction honeypot. Consequently, no one knows to what extent attackers may be detecting and avoiding honeypots. At best, this limits the ability for researchers to develop more robust honeypots which can evade detection. The worse case however is the calling into question the legitimacy of the technology overall.\nAccordingly, in this talk I provide a potential model for honeypot detection along with the results of scanning 59,392 IP Addresses during a series of validation experiments. The findings demonstrate a set of characteristics usable as identification criteria."}]}]},dir:h,path:"\u002Fschedule\u002Fsession-3",extension:f,createdAt:K,updatedAt:i},{slug:"lunch-break",sort:"1150",what:"Lunch Break",start:ar,end:as,mins:70,span:p,header:q,toc:[],body:{type:e,children:[]},dir:h,path:"\u002Fschedule\u002Flunch-break",extension:f,createdAt:"2021-09-19T05:31:03.814Z",updatedAt:i},{slug:"session-4",talk:"A Shock to the System: Static Analysis for Real AppSec",sort:"1300",what:"Session #4",speakers:[{name:at,slug:au}],start:as,end:av,mins:F,span:u,toc:[],body:{type:e,children:[{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Static analysis (SA) is one of the few techniques that provides a low-level examination of source code.

Despite all of these tactics, 90%+ of all losses result from attacks targeting users. What this talk proposes is a comprehensive strategy to address the insider threat, whether it results from malicious or well meaning insiders.\nI refer to the comprehensive strategy as Human Security Engineering (HSE) and it involves creating a model that looks similar to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The strategy involves identifying how a user loss is enabled, how it is initiated, and how loss is ideally mitigated before it can be realized. Applying HSE, security professionals can look at the entire sequence of a potential loss and determine what and where are the most cost effective countermeasures to implement. Applying individual tactics has proved to be ineffective in stopping the problem in large scale.

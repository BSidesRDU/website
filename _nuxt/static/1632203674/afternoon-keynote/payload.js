Either way, the cybersecurity industry realizes this and develops tactics such as awareness, MFA, DLP, etc. to mitigate the problem. Despite all of these tactics, 90%+ of all losses result from attacks targeting users. What this talk proposes is a comprehensive strategy to address the insider threat, whether it results from malicious or well meaning insiders."}]},{type:a,value:i},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I refer to the comprehensive strategy as Human Security Engineering (HSE) and it involves creating a model that looks similar to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The strategy involves identifying how a user loss is enabled, how it is initiated, and how loss is ideally mitigated before it can be realized. Applying HSE, security professionals can look at the entire sequence of a potential loss and determine what and where are the most cost effective countermeasures to implement. Applying individual tactics has proved to be ineffective in stopping the problem in large scale. At least one company has begun to implement HSE and has drastically cut phishing losses."}]},{type:a,value:i},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"This presentation will detail HSE and provide the resources required for attendees to follow up and consider how they can implement HSE to better mitigate their own insider threats."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fsessions",path:"\u002Fsessions\u002Fafternoon-keynote",extension:j,createdAt:"2021-09-21T03:29:23.122Z",updatedAt:k},prev:{slug:"session-7",title:"We Are The (Security) Champions",what:"Session #7",start:"14:45"},next:null,speakers:[{slug:g,type:"speaker",session:e,name:f,title:"CISO, Skyline Technology System and author You Can Stop Stupid",toc:[],body:{type:h,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Ira Winkler, CISSP is CISO for Skyline Technology Solutions and author of You Can Stop Stupid. He is considered one of the world’s most influential security professionals, and has been named a “Modern Day James Bond” by the media. He did this by performing espionage simulations, where he physically and technically “broke into” some of the largest companies in the World and investigating crimes against them, and telling them how to cost effectively protect their information and computer infrastructure. He continues to perform these espionage simulations, as well as assisting organizations in developing cost effective security programs. Ira also won the Hall of Fame award from the Information Systems Security Association, as well as several other prestigious industry awards. CSO Magazine named Ira a CSO Compass Award winner as The Awareness Crusader. Most recently, Ira was named 2021 Top Cybersecurity Leader by Security Magazine."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fspeakers",path:"\u002Fspeakers\u002Fira-winkler",extension:j,createdAt:"2021-09-21T03:29:23.123Z",updatedAt:k}],followedBy:{}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("text","element","p","session","afternoon-keynote","Ira Winkler","ira-winkler","root","\n",".md","2021-09-21T05:35:31.534Z")));

This sparked a plethora of new offsec focused C# tools and executables bypassing the watchful eye of the security community. However, this shift of focus has allowed attackers to learn new techniques on how to bypass and defeat the organic controls that Microsoft has put into place to protect the scripting application. We believe that PowerShell exploits and attack methods are still alive and well. With PowerShell still being deployed on every machine by default, it still is a massive security hole for your organization that could allow an attacker to navigate your environment without ever needing to place an executable “on disk”.

Either way, the cybersecurity industry realizes this and develops tactics such as awareness, MFA, DLP, etc. to mitigate the problem. Despite all of these tactics, 90%+ of all losses result from attacks targeting users.

The strategy involves identifying how a user loss is enabled, how it is initiated, and how loss is ideally mitigated before it can be realized. Applying HSE, security professionals can look at the entire sequence of a potential loss and determine what and where are the most cost effective countermeasures to implement. Applying individual tactics has proved to be ineffective in stopping the problem in large scale. At least one company has begun to implement HSE and has drastically cut phishing losses."}]},{type:a,value:m},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"This presentation will detail HSE and provide the resources required for attendees to follow up and consider how they can implement HSE to better mitigate their own insider threats."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fsessions",path:"\u002Fsessions\u002Fafternoon-keynote",extension:n,createdAt:"2021-09-21T05:55:20.037Z",updatedAt:o},prev:{slug:"session-7",title:"We Are The (Security) Champions","session-type":h,what:"Session #7"},next:{slug:p,"session-type":d,what:q},speakers:[{slug:k,type:"speaker",session:g,name:j,title:"CISO, Skyline Technology System and author You Can Stop Stupid",toc:[],body:{type:l,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Ira Winkler, CISSP is CISO for Skyline Technology Solutions and author of You Can Stop Stupid.

He continues to perform these espionage simulations, as well as assisting organizations in developing cost effective security programs.

## Venue

### The Carolina Theatre

[The Carolina Theatre](http://www.carolinatheatre.org/about) is a performing arts and cinema complex in downtown Durham, North Carolina. It is an AMAZING venue in the Raleigh Durham area!

We are growing! The main conference will be at the Fletcher Hall -- an auditorium with 1,048 seats hosting a diverse lineup of live events and film. Fletcher Hall has been restored to its 1926 d√©cor, and is the only downtown building designed in the Beaux Arts style.

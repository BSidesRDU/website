Software reverse engineering is often regarded as an eldritch skill, reserved for only the most elite and talented security researchers. Getting started is daunting – fraught with rabbit holes, bad YouTube videos, and incomplete blogs and tutorials. We’ll set a foundation for developing the intuition needed to be an effective reverse engineer. This workshop will focus less on specific tools, and more on “What questions do I have, what tool(s) can help answer them, and how should I go about it?”
